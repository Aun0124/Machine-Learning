Collect a set of your own handwritten images, you could use your phone or a scanner to collect images. A felt tip marker works best.

It's easiest to write several images at once on sheet of paper and take one picture, you can crop each image using an image tool and save it in a file as .PNG

In your notebook, import a couple of useful image modules from the skimage library in a cell:

from skimage import io, transform
Read an image as follows:

rgb = io.imread('8.png')
print(f'Original image shape {rgb.shape}')
plt.imshow(rgb)
Convert to grayscale

gray = np.dot(rgb[...,:], [0.299, 0.587, 0.114, 0])
print(f'Grayscale image shape {gray.shape}')
plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')
Resize to 28 x 28 pixels

gray28x28 = transform.resize(gray, (img_rows, img_cols))
print(f'Resized image shape {gray28x28.shape}')
plt.imshow(gray28x28, cmap='gray')
Filter the background

vectorized_filter = np.vectorize(lambda v: 255 if v > 128 else v)
filtered = vectorized_filter(gray28x28)
plt.imshow(filtered, cmap='gray')
Invert the image and scale pixel values

inverted = 255 - filtered
reshaped = inverted.reshape(img_rows, img_cols, 1) / 255.0
batch = np.array([reshaped])
plt.imshow(inverted, cmap='gray')
Make a prediction using your previously trained model

predictions = model.predict(batch)
most_likely = predictions.argmax(1)
most_likely
Plot probabilities

plt.bar(range(10), predictions[0], tick_label=range(10))
plt.title('Prediction values')
plt.show()
Combine all of the steps above into one predict function that accepts an image file name and returns a predicted value like this:

def predict_digit(filename):
    # Your code to predict the value given the image filename
    return prediction
Test your predict_digit() function on your own handwritten images

Here are some tips improve accuracy

Use a felt tip pen (the training digits appear to be written with a wide pen)

Crop images close to the top and bottom of each digit, don't leave a lot of white space (similar to training images)

Questions for this assignment
Why is it necessary to convert images to grayscale?

Can you use the model to measure handwriting quality between different people? How would this work?
